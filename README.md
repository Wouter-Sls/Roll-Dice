# Dice roll

##My first Flutter & Dart project
Dice roll Flutter project.

This project is a simple dice roll application where I learned the basics of Flutter and Dart.

A user can click a button "Roll Dice" to get a random dice image between 1-6.
Furthermore, I learned basic styling by using the BoxDecoration and LinearGradient widgets.
